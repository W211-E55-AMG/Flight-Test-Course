Risk Mitigations
Markup : 1. Midair Collisions
              1.  Dedicate 1 engineer to searching for other aircraft during tests, and frequently monitor ADSB (All Riddle Cessna’s contain Mode S Transponders) during testing and regular flight 
              2.  Once stabilized Pilot will announce to others on training area frequency of location, altitude, and intentions before each run (a run includes all 3 legs of a test) 
              3.  Schedule a flight for an off-peak hour as to reduce the chance of encountering another aircraft in a training area  
              4.  Efficient crew coordination and communication based off established procedures
              
          2. Engine Failure
              1.  Embry Riddle’s part145 repair facility certification which requires many specializations, FAA inspections, and 2 people to write off an aircraft after maintenance has been performed on it 
              2.  Perform Test at higher altitudes (5kft-8kft) to allow for a further glide distance and more time to make decision during the emergency 
              3.  In the training area perform tests near fields that have enough room for an emergency landing 
              4.  Agree on a predetermined airport to glide (for example if testing at bithlo training area the nearest airport would be Space Coast Regional Airport:TIX ) 
              5.  Pilot should stay in command whilst the engineer besides the pilot reads to him the emergency checklist for the occurring failure from the pilot operating handbook
              
          3. Pilot Incapacitation
              1.
