<summary>Risks & Mitigation</summary>

## Associated Risks: ##
These are the general risk assessment that was done for all flights.

Probability | Severity | Event | Safety Risk
| :---: | :---:  | :---:  | :---:
Emxtremely Improbable  | Catastrophic | Midair Collision  |  1A
Remote  | Hazardous | Engine Failure  |  3B
Improbable  | Catastrophic | Pilot Incapacitation  |  2A
Remote  | Hazardous | Bird Strike  |  3A

## Risk Mitigation ##

1. Midair Collisions
    1.  Dedicate 1 engineer to searching for other aircraft during tests, and frequently monitor ADSB (All Riddle Cessna’s contain Mode S Transponders) during testing and regular flight
    2. Once stabilized Pilot will announce to others on training area frequency of location, altitude, and intentions before each run (a run includes all 3 legs of a test)
    3. Schedule a flight for an off-peak hour as to reduce the chance of encountering another aircraft in a training area
    4. Efficient crew coordination and communication based off established procedures
              
2. Engine Failure
   1.  Embry Riddle’s part145 repair facility certification which requires many specializations, FAA inspections, and 2 people to write off an aircraft after maintenance has been performed on it
   2.  Perform Test at higher altitudes (5kft-8kft) to allow for a further glide distance and more time to make decision during the emergency
   3.  In the training area perform tests near fields that have enough room for an emergency landing
   4.  Agree on a predetermined airport to glide (for example if testing at bithlo training area the nearest airport would be Space Coast Regional Airport:TIX )
   5.  Pilot should stay in command whilst the engineer besides the pilot reads to him the emergency checklist for the occurring failure from the pilot operating handbook

3. Pilot Incapacitation
   1. Immediately Declare an emergency to ATC
   2. Just in case this scenario occurs the engineer up front should be the one most versed with the aircraft or that who knows how to manage the radio to talk to atc
   3. The pilot should have some fatigue management procedures in place like proper amount of rest, gaps in-between flights, and workload distribution in the cockpit

4. Bird Strike
   1. KDAB Airport employs cannons to scare away the birds
   2. Fly at altitudes greater than 2000ft AGL to avoid encountering birds
   3. Avoid training areas that contain bird farms
