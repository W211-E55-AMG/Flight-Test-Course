# Simulink Model: Takeoff Analysis

## Overview
This project compares takeoff models using three approaches: 
1. A **Physics-Based Model** of the takeoff run.  
2. An **INS-Based Model** (Inertial Navigation System) created from phone accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data.  
3. A **GPS-Based Model** recorded using phone GPS data.  

The project involves tuning key parameters in the physics-based model to match the INS-based model and comparing results.

## Key Tasks
1. **Physics-Based Model**  
   A physics-based takeoff model was built in Simulink using engine performance as a basis. Key components include:  
   - Aircraft thrust and drag modeling  
   - Rolling friction (Î¼)  
   - Lift calculations based on $C_{L_0}$  

2. **INS-Based Model**  
   - Built using phone-based inertial sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS).  
   - Calculates position, velocity, and acceleration during the takeoff roll.

3. **Model Tuning**  
   The following parameters were tuned in the physics-based model to match the INS model:  
   - Oswald Efficiency Factor (e)  
   - Friction Coefficient (Î¼)  
   - $C_{L_0}$ (Lift Coefficient at zero AOA)  
   - Additional drag factors (f)  

4. **Results**

*Data collection setup using GFRecorder: The image shows one of the two iPads running the GFRecorder app, positioned carefully to maintain a consistent reference frame during flight. Despite our efforts, one iPad failed to collect GPS data, while the other reported erroneous latitude values corresponding to Antarctica. Fortunately, as a backup, we used a personal cell phone running the Phyphox app, ensuring reliable data collection in line with our contingency planning.*


Using the simulink the following images can be generated. First is a lat/long map of the GPS (top) and INS (bottom) method at Deland.

Then the groundspeed and distance down the runway could be calculated as seen below:

6. **Distance to 1.2 Vso**  
   The takeoff distance required to reach 1.2 times the stall speed $V_{SO}$
 is computed.  
   - Daytona: Between **900 ft and 1200 ft**.  
   - Deland: Similar range.

## Test Locations and Results
Data for the takeoff runs was recorded at the following airports:  
- **Daytona Beach Airport**: Two clean runs recorded.  
- **Deland Airport**: Additional clean run recorded.  

| Parameter             | Daytona Run | Deland Run |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|
| Friction Coefficient (Î¼) | 0.1         | 0.8        |
| Distance to 1.2 Vso   | 900â€“1200 ft | 900â€“1200 ft|

## Models Overview (Dropdown Sections for Details)
<details>
<summary>INS-Based Model</summary>
The INS-based model uses data from a phone app that records accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS signals.  
- **Tools Used**: Phone sensors and data fusion.  
- **Challenges**: Outlier corrections and sensor noise management.

Below is the INS system:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b81ba5c8-ee3b-4f9b-a71e-ae840c5abd50)

The **Angles Daytona** subsystem takes roll, pitch, and yaw rates frrom the gyroscope and converts them into roll, pitch, and yaw. It is important to note that the original yaw position is very important to insert into the integrator.

The **1D-INS (Daytona)** subsystem, shown below, performs two primary tasks:

1. **Distance Calculation in the Body Frame**:  
   The system integrates the \( N_x \) acceleration (forward acceleration in the body frame) to compute the distance traveled. This calculation only considers the **pitch** axis, excluding other rotational transformations. The **Ned to Body** subsystem does this task.  
   - To ensure accuracy at takeoff, \( N_x \) is zeroed out at the starting point by subtracting the initial \( N_x \) value from the entire \( N_x \) array. Subtracting Nz by the acceleration due to gravity is addtionally an important part of the process.

2. **Transformation to the NED Frame**:  
   The subsystem converts the body-frame accelerations (\( N_x, N_y, N_z \)) into the **NED (North-East-Down)** reference frame using a standard **321 rotation** (roll-pitch-yaw transformation).  
   - The transformed accelerations are integrated within their respective reference axes to obtain velocities and positions in the NED frame.

This approach ensures that both body-frame distance and global NED-frame positions are accurately computed.

<summary>GPS-Based Model</summary>
The GPS-based model uses position data logged by the phone's GPS sensors.  
- **Tools Used**: Phyphox App for data logging.  
- **Challenges**: Low time resolution and occasional GPS errors.

The GPS system can be seen below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9443c760-0433-40f4-ba92-60028cb675c0)

The **GPS (daytona)** subsystem is shown below. It uses 1D lookup tables that read from the Matlab workspace. It additionally converts lat/long to NED.

The **Absolute dist** subsystem can be seen below. This just adjusts to where you would like to start your takeoff.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87488ec5-46b7-4a65-979c-3ccbe74b5026)

The **groundspeed**  subsystem is only used as alternative method to calculate velocity in case the provided velocity the phone calculates includes the Z axis.

<summary>Physics-Based Simulink Model</summary>
The Simulink model uses equations of motion for takeoff and landing with engine performance inputs.  
- Includes rolling friction, lift, drag, and thrust forces.  
- Tuning parameters include e, Î¼, $C_{L_0}$, and f.

The Physics-Based Submodel can be seen below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7358e474-0706-4eb9-bfcd-0ce7e8459a16)

The base **Engine Model** is very similiar to the one used in the power avaiable assignment. More details can be found there, the subsystem can be seen below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82a6b94c-f0f1-43d4-8bc7-c06ccb755679)

The drag can be calculated with the following collections of blocks below. The **Cl Equation subsystem** is a $C_{L}$ =  $C_{L_0}$ + $C_{L_Î±}$ 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19cabe97-79b1-4edd-b870-cd083440f301)

The **Drag & Friction** subsystem calculates induced drag, parasyte drag, and rolling friction.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73733d08-b051-4a77-a857-31a69fc457b7)

Finally you can use the equations of motions to get position and velocity.
