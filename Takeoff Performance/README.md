# Simulink Model: Takeoff Analysis

## Overview
This project compares takeoff models using three approaches: 
1. A **Physics-Based Model** of the takeoff run.  
2. An **INS-Based Model** (Inertial Navigation System) created from phone accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data.  
3. A **GPS-Based Model** recorded using phone GPS data.  

The project involves tuning key parameters in the physics-based model to match the INS-based model and comparing results.

## Key Tasks
1. **Physics-Based Model**  
   A physics-based takeoff model was built in Simulink using engine performance as a basis. Key components include:  
   - Aircraft thrust and drag modeling  
   - Rolling friction (Î¼)  
   - Lift calculations based on $C_{L_0}$  

2. **INS-Based Model**  
   - Built using phone-based inertial sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS).  
   - Calculates position, velocity, and acceleration during the takeoff roll.

3. **Model Tuning**  
   The following parameters were tuned in the physics-based model to match the INS model:  
   - Oswald Efficiency Factor (e)  
   - Friction Coefficient (Î¼)  
   - $C_{L_0}$ (Lift Coefficient at zero AOA)  
   - Additional drag factors (f)  

4. **Results**

*Data collection setup using GFRecorder: The image shows one of the two iPads running the GFRecorder app, positioned carefully to maintain a consistent reference frame during flight. Despite our efforts, one iPad failed to collect GPS data, while the other reported erroneous latitude values corresponding to Antarctica. Fortunately, as a backup, we used a personal cell phone running the Phyphox app, ensuring reliable data collection in line with our contingency planning.*


Using the simulink the following images can be generated. First is a lat/long map of the GPS (top) and INS (bottom) method at Deland.

Then the groundspeed and distance down the runway could be calculated as seen below:

6. **Distance to 1.2 Vso**  
   The takeoff distance required to reach 1.2 times the stall speed $V_{SO}$
 is computed.  
   - Daytona: Between **900 ft and 1200 ft**.  
   - Deland: Similar range.

## Test Locations and Results
Data for the takeoff runs was recorded at the following airports:  
- **Daytona Beach Airport**: Two clean runs recorded.  
- **Deland Airport**: Additional clean run recorded.  

| Parameter             | Daytona Run | Deland Run |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|
| Friction Coefficient (Î¼) | 0.1         | 0.8        |
| Distance to 1.2 Vso   | 900â€“1200 ft | 900â€“1200 ft|
